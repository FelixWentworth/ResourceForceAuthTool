            <h3>Creating New Content</h3>
            <label>
                To start creating new content for Resource Force, click on the "Create New Scenario" button on the <a ui-sref="home()">home</a> once logged in. Logging in as a member will allow you to track all of your content you have created, logging in as a guest will allow you to create and submit content only
                <br/>
                When creating a scenario, you must select a location and a language, this is where the content will be available to players in Resource Force. If you want your content to be available in multiple locations or languages, you can make a copy of the scenario and change the settings as required
                <br/>
                There are 3 key sections to creating a new scenario: Summary, Start and Options.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <b>Summary</b>
                <br/>
                Provide information which defines the scenario and where it will be available
                <br/><b>Title</b>: Name for the scenario
                <br/><b>Location</b>: The location that the scenario will be available at
                <br/><b>Language</b>: Defines the language the scenario is written in
                <br/>
                <br/>                
                <b>Start</b>
                <br/>
                The beginning of the crime that has been committed, the initial report that a decision needs to be made for.
                <br/><b>Incident Title</b>: Short name for current report eg. Vandalism
                <br/><b>Description</b>: More details about the report eg. 2 Youths spotted vandalising a public bus
                <br/><b>Severity</b>: How severe the incident is: 1 = low, 2 = medium, 3 = high 
                <br/><b>Number of Officers Required</b>: How many officers would be required to solve the crime 
                <br/><b>Turns Officers Needed For</b>: How many turns officers would need to solve the crime
                <br/>
                Once the information has been provided, there must be at least 2 options available to the player, choose from "Ignore", "Ask Citizen" and "Send Officer"
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <b>Options</b>
                <br/>
                Each option gives feedback on the decision made and a development in the report, either solved or developed further 
                <br/><b>Feedback Rating</b>: Rating for the decision, 1=worst, 2=bad, 3=neutral, 4=good, 5=best
                <br/><b>Feedback Description</b>: A short description for the reason for the rating eg. sending officers is not necessary for this type of crime 
                <br/>
                The "Next Incident Information" should be filled in the same style as the 'Start' section, with the addition of the <b>End Impact</b> which is the rating that is awarded to the player when the case no longer develops and is completed: -5=worst, 0=neutral, 5=best
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Each option can develop further or end, depending on the number of options available. If no options are available, this indicates the end of the current branch.
                <br/>
                Once all fields are filled in, the "Save Scenario" button at the bottom of the page will become available. If signed in as a guest, this will be a submit scenario button instead.
